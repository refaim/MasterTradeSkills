- Show what tradeskill level is required to use the recipe
- Show current trade skill level
- Show the skill color of the recipe
- Show names of alts who know the recipe
- Show if the recipe is ingredient of another recipe (refer to +/- in front of the recipe)

### Usage

### Legacy README from Triadian
> No idea why this mod slipped into non-existance, so i dragged it back kicking and screaming - if you wanna flame me
> for doing you will be ignored at Triadian@Gmail.com i will only be updating at http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2146
> and http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4773-master-trade-skills.html
> so if you write a comment elsewhere i might not see it.
> 
> any nice suggestions or improvements let me know and i'll try and implement them
> but my knowledge of UI isn't that brilliant.

> German Localization by Farook. Thanks
